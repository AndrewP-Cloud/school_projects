# school_projects
These are projects that were most complete for my classes.
I have uploaded all of the completed ones into this one repository until I am better able to organize and create my portfolio.

I chose to only use one repository because they are past and a few have broken parts so I am only using this as a means to show familiarity.
Unless they are from the 2017 Folder they were created in 2020 & 2021.

My classes were both Java, but I am currently learning Python and JavaScript so you can expect new projects for those soon.
