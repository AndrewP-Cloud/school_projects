# school_projects
These are projects that were most complete for my classes.
I have uploaded all of the completed ones until I am better able to organize and create my portfolio.
Unless they are from the 2017 Folder they were created in 2020 & 2021.

My classes were both Java, but I am currently learning Python and JavaScript so you can expect new projects for those soon.
