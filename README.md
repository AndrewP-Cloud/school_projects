# school_projects
These are projects that were most complete for my classes.
I have uploaded all of the completed ones into this one repository until I am better able to organize and create my portfolio.

***CURRENTLY MOST OF MY CODING IS DONE ON CODECADEMY SO I AM STILL ACTIVELY LEARNING. THE PURPOSE OF THESE ARE TO DISPLAY 
THAT I HAVE CODED AND UNDERSTAND JAVA AND OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING FUNDEMENTALS***

I chose to only use one repository because they are past and a few have broken parts so I am only using this as a means to show familiarity.

I am still in the process of actively organizing this folder as of 1/11/2022

My classes were both Java, but I am currently learning other languages so you can expect new projects for those soon.
I will be leaving this open so that my development can be addressed when I have completed more advanced projects.

***NOTE: All of my college projects aren't here because I was horribly unorganized and uninterested in coding in my college career***
