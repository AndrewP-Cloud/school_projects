# school_projects
These are projects that were most complete for my classes.
I have uploaded all of the completed ones into this one repository until I am better able to organize and create my portfolio.

I chose to only use one repository because they are past and a few have broken parts so I am only using this as a means to show familiarity.

I am still in the process of actively organizing this folder as of 2/10/21

My classes were both Java, but I am currently learning Python and JavaScript so you can expect new projects for those soon.
When I have new projects I feel shows my skills this will become hidden.
